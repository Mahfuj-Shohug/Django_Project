## CRUD Operations

The project includes basic CRUD operations for managing data. You can perform the following actions:

- **Create**: Add new items to the database.
- **Read**: View the list of items and details of each item.
- **Update**: Edit and update existing items.
- **Delete**: Remove items from the database.

## API

The project also provides a RESTful API for interacting with the data. You can use tools like [curl](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to make API requests.

API endpoints:

- `GET /api/items/`: Retrieve a list of all items.
- `GET /api/items/<item_id>/`: Retrieve details of a specific item.
- `POST /api/items/`: Create a new item.
- `PUT /api/items/<item_id>/`: Update a specific item.
- `DELETE /api/items/<item_id>/`: Delete a specific item.
